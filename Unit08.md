**Unit 8: Code Generation** <span id="8"></span> 
*This unit is closely related to Unit 7, where the emphasis was on
representation of data structures needed for run-time.  While there will
be some overlap, the emphasis in this unit is on instruction-level
intermediate code generation and from intermediate code to target
code.*  
  
 *The* *lastphase* *(or next to the last phase if there is a code
optimization phase)* *of the compilation process is code generation,
where the output from the previous steps is finally translated into
machine code, ready to execute on the target platform.  In this unit, we
will start with a discussion of code generation in general before moving
on to a more detailed description of the code generation process.  This
will include an in-depth discussion of three main areas: Instruction
Selection, Instruction Scheduling, and Register Allocation.  By the end
of this unit, you will have a firm understanding of the code generation
process.*

**Unit 8 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take approximately 16 hours to complete.

    describes the translation from a low-level intermediate language to
    machine code.  This translation addresses the handling of
    restrictions on the machine language; for example, a finite number
    of registers is a restriction of a target machine and its machine
    language.  The intermediate language assumes an unlimited number of
    registers, i.e., virtual register machine.

    used in an intermediate language translation into a smaller number
    of registers, plus memory locations available on the target
    machine.  Chapter 10 covers function calls using a stack, activation
    records, and frame pointers.  Look over these chapters and read the

**8.5 Verification and Validation of Code Generation** <span
id="8.5"></span> 
*Note: As with previous parts of a compiler and previous steps of the
compilation process, we are interested in the verification (i.e., does
the code generator work correctly) and the validation (i.e., does the
code generator satisfy the requirements as part of the compiler).  The
same kinds of techniques used for the previous parts of a compiler
apply, as well, to the code generator. *  
  
 *If our code generator produces intermediate code and we have a known
“correct” generator from* *intermediate code to machine code, then our
V&V efforts can focus on the translation to intermediate code.* 
*Moreover, if we have a known “correct” compiler from another source
language that is similar to our source language and satisfies similar
requirements, we could write a simple translator between them and show
that the simple translator is correct.  Again, if we want to verify
intermediate code to assembler code, and we have a known “correct”
generator from the same intermediate language to another assembler
language, we could write a simple translator between the assembler
languages and then verify that translator. *  
  
 *The use of an intermediate language has another benefit: it can make
the use of formal proofs of correctness easier than their use on AST to
target language generation. Lastly, measurements of process time and
memory usage will be needed to validate time and space requirements.  *

    (PDF)  
      
     Instructions: Please click on the link above, and then select “Get
    the book contents” to download a PDF version of the book.  Complete
    the following:  
      
     Exercise \#1: Do Exercise 7.1 in Mogensen’s “Chapter 7
    Intermediate-Code Generation” on page 173.  
      
     Exercise \#2:  Do Exercise 8.2 in Mogensen’s “Chapter 8
    Machine-Code Generation” on page 189.  
      
     These exercises will give you some practice with code generation
    and are based on Chapter 7, which covers intermediate code
    generation, and Chapter 8, which covers machine code generation. 
    Intermediate code can be high level, i.e. close to the input
    language, or low level, i.e. close to the target machine language,
    and, hence, though Exercise \#2 jumps to Chapter 8, the process of
    syntax directed translation is the same.  These exercises illustrate
    the process for syntax directed translation to intermediate code or
    machine code.  You can check your answers with the Saylor
    Foundation’s “[Answer
    Key](https://resources.saylor.org/archived/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/CS304-Unit-8-Answer-Key-to-Assessment-6-FINAL.pdf)”
