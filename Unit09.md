**Unit 9: Code Optimization** <span id="9"></span> 
*Simply compiling and executing a program is not enough to get the most
out of your code.  It is the optimization process that allows your code
to run as effectively* *and efficientlyas possible.  In this unit, we
will first take a look at optimization, learning what it is and why we
are interested in it.  Next, we will review different optimization
categories, including Peephole, Local, Loop, Language Dependent, and
Machine Dependent.  We will conclude with a discussion of different
optimization techniques.  By the end of this unit, you will have a basic
understanding of a wide range of optimization techniques and how they
improve the effectiveness of your program.*

**Unit 9 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take approximately 22 hours to complete.

    constant propagation), which moves information forward, and backward
    analysis (e.g., liveness), which moves information backward.  Note
    slide 5, which states that dynamic properties of a program are
    undecidable.

    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Select the PDF for Lecture 14.  Read slides 18
    through 20 and slides 24 through 32.  These slides essentially state
    that an optimization must not change the behavior of the generated
    code.  This includes introducing errors and changing the semantics. 
    The V&V (verification and validation) techniques mentioned for the
    other parts of a compiler also apply to optimization.  In addition,
    these slides suggest that the formalisms for optimization—e.g.,
    soundness—are directly applicable.
